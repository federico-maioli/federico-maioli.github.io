Hi there! My name is Federico Maioli. I am a quantitative marine ecologist born in Parma, a city in the Italian hinterland equidistant from the east coast and the west coast, perhaps one of the furthest cities from the sea in Italy. The climate is humid, but you can eat well.

I study and model the spatio-temporal distribution of marine species, mainly elasmobranchs. I am an enthusiastic user of [Hmsc](https://github.com/hmsc-r/HMSC) and [sdmTMB](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/index.html) and all kind of species distribution models.

When not modelling species distribution, I enjoy spending time outdoor, scuba diving, free-diving, and photographing wildlife.
